## ❓ **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

### **Q: Which tool should I use first?**
**A:** Start with **Bing Image Creator**. It's unlimited, free, and easiest to use. Just sign in with a Microsoft account and paste prompts!

### **Q: Do I need to pay for anything?**
**A:** NO! All tools in this guide have generous free tiers. You can generate 50+ images per day across all tools without paying anything.

### **Q: Should I use AI images or my existing product photos?**
**A:** **BOTH!** Start by uploading your existing product photos to the lookbook (you already have great shots). Then generate 5-10 AI lifestyle images to show your products in action.

### **Q: The AI image doesn't look exactly like my product. What do I do?**
**A:** This is normal! AI tools create similar designs, not exact replicas. Use these as lifestyle/concept images. Your actual product photos show the real items. You can also mention in the prompt: "based on [your design]" for better results.

### **Q: How many images do I need for the lookbook?**
**A:** Minimum: 6-8 images (mix of product shots and lifestyle). Ideal: 12-20 images. Start small and add more over time!

### **Q: Can I edit AI-generated images?**
**A:** Yes! Use free tools like:
- **Canva.com** - Add text, crop, adjust colors
- **Photopea.com** - Free Photoshop alternative
- **Remove.bg** - Remove backgrounds

### **Q: What if the AI adds text or logos I don't want?**
**A:** Some AI tools add watermarks or random text. To avoid:
- Don't mention "text" or "logo" in prompts
- Use Photopea or Canva to crop/remove unwanted elements
- Try generating again with "no text, no watermarks" in prompt

### **Q: How do I make the glow effect look realistic?**
**A:** Key phrases in prompts:
- "bright neon green glow"
- "phosphorescent light"
- "the glow illuminates the surrounding area"
- "in darkness" or "at night"
- "high contrast lighting"

### **Q: Can I use these images for Instagram/Facebook ads?**
**A:** YES! All images you generate with free AI tools can be used commercially for your business. Just check each tool's terms (they're usually very permissive).

### **Q: What's the fastest way to get a lookbook live today?**
**A:** 
1. Upload 4-6 of your best existing product photos (10 minutes)
2. Generate 2-3 AI lifestyle images with Bing (30 minutes)
3. Upload to `/public/lookbook/` folder
4. Update lookbook page with image paths (10 minutes)
**Total: ~1 hour!**

### **Q: My Bing Image Creator says "Creating..." forever**
**A:** Try these:
- Refresh the page and try again
- Simplify your prompt (remove some details)
- Try during off-peak hours (early morning)
- Use Leonardo.ai instead (usually faster)
