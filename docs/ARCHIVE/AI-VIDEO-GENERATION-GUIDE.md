## 🎯 **USING YOUR EXISTING CATALOG IMAGES**

### Step 1: Identify Your Best Images
```
From your /public/products/ folder, select:
✓ Clear, well-lit product photos
✓ Different designs (Tiger, Leopard, etc.)
✓ Both flat lays and model shots (if you have them)
✓ Close-up texture shots
```

### Step 2: Create Image Pairs
```
For day/night transitions, you'll need:

Option A: If you have BOTH versions:
- Daylight product photo (non-glowing)
- Same product with glow effect

Option B: If you only have ONE version:
- Use AI to create the opposite state
- Example: Have glow photo? Generate daylight version first
```

### Step 3: Prep Images for Video AI
```
1. Crop to 1:1 or 16:9 ratio
2. Ensure minimum 1024x1024px
3. Save as JPG or PNG
4. Keep file size under 10MB
```
