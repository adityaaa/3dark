**Date:** December 9, 2024  
**Priority:** 🔴🔴 **CRITICAL - HIGHER THAN INVENTORY**  
**Impact:** First impressions, brand trust, conversion rate  
**Issue:** Homepage doesn't match actual business

---

## 🔍 **CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

### **Brand Identity Crisis** 🚨

**Homepage Says:**
- "GLOW-IN-THE-DARK OUTFITS"
- "Hyper-realistic glow gear built for the night"
- "Charges in 10-15 minutes, glows for hours"
- Target: "riders, gamers, and night-life"

**Actual Business Is:**
- Wildlife-inspired streetwear (tigers, leopards, pandas, wolves, eagles)
- T-shirts, shorts, pants, beanies
- For adults and kids
- Brands: Caballo, RC (Royal Collection)
- **NO glow-in-the-dark functionality mentioned anywhere**

**Meta Title:**
- "3Dark – Wildlife-Inspired Streetwear | T-Shirts, Shorts & More"

**About Page:**
- "Where Wildlife Meets Streetwear"
- Focus on animal designs, not glow features

### **This is a MAJOR disconnect!** Customers will be confused and lose trust.
